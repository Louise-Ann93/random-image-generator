# Image Generator 

This project is a random image generator using 20 random images included within the files. 

The project was built to go along with an in person team game based on communication. 

The aim of the game is to describe the image youâ€™re seeing to your team and/or partner. 
You are not allowed to be literal when describing the image. 
This can be a great game to test your communication style to see how your team or partner can interpret your description of the image. Are they able to draw exactly what you see? Or are there things that they miss interpret.
